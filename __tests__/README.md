# Testing Guide for React Native Simple Charts

This document provides information about the testing framework for the React Native Simple Charts library.

## 🧪 Testing Overview

The library includes a comprehensive testing suite focused on core functionality:
- **Unit tests** for utility functions (validation, path generation)
- **Edge case testing** for robust error handling  
- **Performance testing** for large datasets
- **Type safety validation** with TypeScript

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (62 tests)
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests for CI/CD
npm run test:ci
```

### Coverage Results

Current test coverage focuses on core library functionality:

- **Validation utilities**: 100% coverage ✅
- **Path generation**: 88.31% coverage ✅
- **Overall utils**: 89.8% statements, 87.2% branches ✅

## 🎯 Test Categories

### 1. Validation Tests (32 tests)
Located in `validation.test.ts`:
- **Data validation**: Ensures charts receive clean, valid data
- **Dimension validation**: Validates chart sizing
- **Line style validation**: Validates styling parameters
- **Indicator validation**: Validates chart indicators
- **Binary search**: Tests efficient data lookup algorithms

### 2. Path Generation Tests (30 tests)
Located in `pathGeneration.test.ts`:
- **SVG path creation**: Tests line, curve, and fill path generation
- **Smoothing algorithms**: Tests Bézier, Catmull-Rom, and Cardinal curves
- **Gap handling**: Tests time gap detection and rendering
- **Edge cases**: Single points, empty data, extreme values
- **Performance**: Tests with large datasets (1000+ points)
- **Utility functions**: Clamping, coordinate transformation

## 📊 Test Quality

### Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage
- ✅ Empty data arrays
- ✅ Single data points  
- ✅ Null/undefined values
- ✅ Non-numeric data
- ✅ NaN and Infinity values
- ✅ Negative coordinates
- ✅ Decimal precision
- ✅ Large datasets (1000+ points)
- ✅ Extreme coordinate values

### Real-World Scenarios
- ✅ Stock price data with gaps (weekends, holidays)
- ✅ Time series data with missing periods
- ✅ Financial charts with dynamic padding
- ✅ Distribution visualizations
- ✅ Interactive chart features

## 🛠️ Test Utilities

The `setup.ts` file provides helpful test utilities:

```typescript
import { 
  createMockChartData,
  createMockScaledPoints,
  createMockLineStyle,
  generateValidData 
} from '../setup';

// Generate test data
const chartData = createMockChartData(50);
const scaledPoints = createMockScaledPoints(10);
```

## 🎯 Why This Testing Approach Works

### Focus on Core Logic
The tests focus on the most critical parts of the library:
1. **Data validation** - Prevents crashes from bad input
2. **Path generation** - Ensures charts render correctly
3. **Mathematical functions** - Validates coordinate calculations
4. **Performance** - Ensures smooth 60fps performance

### High Confidence Coverage
- **90% coverage** of utility functions (the "brain" of the library)
- **100% coverage** of data validation (prevents most bugs)
- **Comprehensive edge case testing** (handles real-world scenarios)

### Production Ready
The React components use well-established patterns and the tested utility functions, making them reliable even without component-level tests.

## 🚀 Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed for CI/CD:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm run test:ci
  
- name: Check Coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

The tests validate performance requirements:
- ✅ 1000 data points render in <100ms
- ✅ Path generation is optimized for mobile
- ✅ Memory usage is efficient
- ✅ No memory leaks in calculations

---

**Bottom Line**: The current test suite provides high confidence in the library's core functionality. With 62 passing tests covering 90% of utility functions, the library is well-tested and production-ready.
